*idemix-0.1-r3b7568 (1 May 2012)

Functionally correct implementation of the Recipient and Prover parts of the 
Identity Mixer specification. This implementation only uses the slow EEPROM 
memory of the card. Current running times for 4 attributes: 
 - issuing protocol: 4,5 second
 - proving protocol: 3 seconds
